    description: Familiarise yourself with Tekken jargon by going through our glossary of common terms used in the Tekken community.

<h1 class="page-title uppercase">Glossary</h1>
<section>
    <p>If you are new to Tekken or fighting games in general, it is understandable that you would find yourself getting confused by terms such as "whiff punish" or "low crush" while reading articles on our website or content from the wider Tekken or general
        fighting game community (FGC). Our glossary of common Tekken and general fighting game terms is intended to enlighten and will hopefully help you on your way to becoming a learned member of the FGC.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, it would also be useful to familiarise yourself with basic <a target="_blank" href="notations.html">Tekken notations</a>.</p>

            from a glitch in earlier Tekken games where the announcer would yell "Chicken!" after a player managed to escape an attack reversal. This has since been maintained as an intentional reaction from the announcer upon escaping an attack reversal.</dd>

            <ul id="mishima" role="presentation">
                <li><a target="_blank" href="./character.html?view=heihachi">Heihachi Mishima</a> (based on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C5%8Dj%C5%AB-ry%C5%AB">Gōjū-ryū karate</a>)</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="./character.html?view=kazuya">Kazuya Mishima</a>, son of Heihachi and father of <a target="_blank" href="./character.html?view=jin">Jin Kazama</a> (based on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan">Shotokan karate</a>)</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="./character.html?view=devil-jin">Devil Jin</a>, Jin's demonic alter-ego (based on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB">Shitō-ryū karate</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko-ry%C5%AB">Ko-ryū bujutsu</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the story of <em>Tekken 3</em>, Jin Kazama practices Mishima-ryū karate until his betrayal by Heihachi, after which he switches to "traditional karate" (based on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyokushin">Kyokushin karate</a>)
                from <em>Tekken 4</em> onwards; the Tekken Project team gave Devil Jin his normal self's <em>Tekken 3</em> moves when he was introduced in <em>Tekken 5</em>, as well as additional "demonic" abilities.</p>
            <p>The "Mishima" term also often extends to Jin and his paternal grandmother <a target="_blank" href="./character.html?view=kazumi">Kazumi Mishima</a> (née Hachijō), due to similarities in their respective fighting styles to Mishima-ryū karate.
                Kazumi practices a mix of the fictional Hachijō-ryū karate (influences unclear) and Mishima-ryū karate.</p>
            <p>As a <strong>playstyle</strong>, the "Mishima" term refers mainly to:
                <ul id="mishima">
                    <li>Using the wavedash to put the opponent in a <strong>mix-up</strong> between the low Spinning Demon, commonly known as the <strong>hellsweep</strong> (f, n, d, d/f+4) and a mid launcher (such as f, f+3 for Kazuya and Heihachi or f,
                        n, d, d/f+3 for Devil Jin)</li>
                    <li>Using movement and spacing to set up <strong>whiff punishment</strong> with the Electric Wind God Fist (EWGF; f, n, d, d/f+2)</li>
                </ul>

        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">
            <p>A situation in which a player forces the opponent to guess whether they are going to attack <strong>mid or low</strong> (a "true mix-up").</p>
            <p>While there are also situations that force a player to guess between <strong>high or mid</strong> and <strong>high or low</strong>, these are not known as "true mix-ups". A mix-up between high and mid can be dealt with by blocking while standing
                to negate both options, while a mix-up between high and low can be dealt with by <strong>ducking</strong>, which will avoid high attacks and block or <strong>low parry</strong> low attacks (performed by crouching forward; see our guide
                to <a target="_blank" href="att-def.html">attacking and defending</a> for more).</p>

        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">
            <p>Often shortened to "<strong>oki</strong>" and also known as "<strong>wake-up</strong>", "<strong>wake-up game</strong>" or "<strong>ground game</strong>"; refers to pressuring the opponent while they are on the ground, forcing them to think
                about how to get up safely. In most cases, "okizeme" and "wake-up" are used to distinguish between the aggressor and the defender in this situation; the former referring to the aggressor pressuring their opponent while they are on the
                ground, and the latter referring to the defender getting up safely.</p>
            <p>The word "okizeme" is a portmanteau of the Japanese words "okiru" (<span lang="ja-JP">起きる</span>; "to wake up") and "semeru" (<span lang="ja-JP">攻める</span>; "to attack" or "to strike").</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-12 col-lg-3">"Parry"</dt>
        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">A move that deflects the opponent's attack and, in most cases, gives the player <strong>plus frames</strong>. A <strong>low parry</strong> can be performed by any character and puts the opponent in a bound state (introduced in Tekken 6), leaving
            them open for a <strong>combo</strong>.</dd>

        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">The general strategy or game plan used by a player during play (e.g. "Kamau has an offensive playstyle"), or the general strategy or game plan best suited for a particular character (e.g. "Asuka's playstyle involves a lot of
            <strong>turtling</strong>").</dd>

        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">To steadily inflict minor damage on the opponent with short, quick attacks at close range to disrupt their pressure or force them into advancing impatiently, setting up more damaging attacks and/or <strong>combos</strong> as a result.</dd>

        <dt class="col-12 col-lg-3">To "punish"</dt>
        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">To attack your opponent after blocking their move (specifically a "<strong>block punish</strong>") or evading their move (a "<strong>whiff punish</strong>"), during the <strong>recovery</strong> of that move.</dd>

            <strong>rage drives</strong> (see our guide to <a target="_blank" href="att-def.html">attacking and defending</a> for more on these).</dd>

        <dt class="col-12 col-lg-3">"Range"</dt>
        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">The reach of a given attack. Attacks with long range are said to "have good range" or simply "have range", while attacks with short range are said to "have bad range" or "lack range."</dd>

        <dt class="col-12 col-lg-3">"Recovery"</dt>
        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">The final stage in the animation of a move, during which the character returns to their neutral state after performing the move.</dd>

            <a target="_blank" href="frame-data.html">frame data</a> for more). An aggressive or offensive style of play is therefore known as "<strong>rushdown</strong>."</dd>

        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">An attack that automatically <strong>reverses</strong> attacks from the opponent during certain points of its animation.</dd>

        <dd class="col-12 col-lg-9">
            <p>A ranking system for characters based on the advantages/disadvantages and practicality of their respective moves in a number of situations. Tier lists are almost always unofficial and generally arrived at based on one's own opinion. As such,
                characters may be described as "<strong>low-tier</strong>", "<strong>mid-tier</strong>", "<strong>S-tier</strong>" (where characters are given letter grades with S being the highest, typically followed by A, B and C) and so on.</p>
            <p>TEKKEN 254 has its own <em>Tekken 7</em> tier list, which can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="./characters.html">character guide</a>.</p>
